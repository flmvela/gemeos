# Gemeos Project Management Summary

## Executive Summary

The Gemeos AI-powered learning platform is 80% complete with its Phase 1 foundation. The platform successfully implements core multi-tenant architecture, domain/concept management, and basic AI pipeline infrastructure. However, critical user management features, class systems, and AI feedback loops require completion to achieve the product vision.

## Current State Assessment
