The pages tab of the rbac-management page must be changed as follow: 
1. Remove the user role (platform-admin, tenant_admin, etc from the four columns on the right side of the page
2. In the left side of the grid add 
2.1 a column which includes a canonical page name (admin dashboard, tenant dashboard, etc)
2.2 the url corresponding to that canonical page (for admin dashboard admin/dashboard, for tenant dashboard tenant/dashboard, etc)
2.3 the description of the page

Remove any grouping based on the sidebar menue and any section header... just list all pages
