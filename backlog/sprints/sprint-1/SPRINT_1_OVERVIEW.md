# Sprint 1: Foundation Complete - Multi-Tenant User Management

**Sprint Duration:** 2 weeks  
**Sprint Goal:** Complete core multi-tenant user management foundation  
**Sprint Status:** ACTIVE  
**Start Date:** September 3, 2025  
**Target End Date:** September 17, 2025  

## Sprint Objectives

Complete the foundational multi-tenant user management system that enables:
1. Role-based authentication (Platform Admin, Tenant Admin, Teacher, Student)
2. Tenant administrator capabilities for user management  
3. Email notification system for user invitations and system alerts

## Task Prioritization (P0 = Highest Priority)

### P0 - Foundation Blocker ðŸš¨
**Enhanced Authentication System (L effort)**
- **Assignee:** TDD-Software-Engineer + Solution-Architect  
- **Dependencies:** None (Foundation task)
- **Status:** IN_PROGRESS
- **File:** `infrastructure/enhanced-authentication-system.md`

### P1 - Depends on Enhanced Auth ðŸ”„  
**Tenant Admin Role Implementation (L effort)**
- **Assignee:** TDD-Software-Engineer
- **Dependencies:** Enhanced Authentication System (P0)
- **Status:** IN_PROGRESS (Waiting for Auth foundation)
- **File:** `features/tenant-admin-role-implementation.md`

### P2 - Parallel Development âš¡
**Email Notification Service (M effort)**  
- **Assignee:** Backend-Engineer
- **Dependencies:** None (Can develop in parallel)
- **Status:** IN_PROGRESS
- **File:** `infrastructure/email-notification-service.md`

## Development Workflow Coordination

### Week 1 Focus
1. **Days 1-2:** Enhanced Authentication System design and foundation
2. **Days 3-5:** Role-based authentication implementation + Email service setup (parallel)

### Week 2 Focus  
1. **Days 1-3:** Tenant Admin Role implementation (depends on auth completion)
2. **Days 4-5:** Integration testing, final Sprint 1 validation

## Team Coordination Plan

### Phase 1: Architecture & Design (Days 1-2)
- **Solution-Architect:** Design multi-tenant authentication architecture
- **TDD-Software-Engineer:** Create test specifications for role-based auth
- **Backend-Engineer:** Email service architecture and provider selection

### Phase 2: Foundation Implementation (Days 3-5)
- **TDD-Software-Engineer:** Implement Enhanced Authentication System
- **Backend-Engineer:** Email notification service development (parallel)
- **Project-Manager:** Daily standups and blocker resolution

### Phase 3: Integration & Testing (Days 6-10)
- **TDD-Software-Engineer:** Tenant Admin Role implementation  
- **Tester:** Comprehensive testing of all Sprint 1 components
- **UX-Designer:** User interface validation for admin features

## Success Metrics

### Technical Success Criteria
- [ ] 4 user roles implemented and functional (Platform Admin, Tenant Admin, Teacher, Student)
- [ ] JWT tokens include role and tenant claims
- [ ] Route protection middleware operational
- [ ] Tenant admins can create and manage teacher accounts
- [ ] Email notifications working for user invitations
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met for each task
- [ ] Test coverage >95% for authentication components
- [ ] Security audit passed

### User Experience Success Criteria  
- [ ] Tenant admin dashboard functional
- [ ] Email templates working with tenant branding
- [ ] Role-based UI components display correctly
- [ ] Authentication flows intuitive and smooth

## Risk Mitigation

### High Risk: Authentication Complexity
- **Impact:** Delay in foundational system
- **Mitigation:** TDD approach, frequent integration testing, solution architect oversight
- **Contingency:** Simplify to basic roles first, enhance in Sprint 2

### Medium Risk: Email Deliverability
- **Impact:** User invitation system unreliable  
- **Mitigation:** Use established provider (SendGrid), implement retry logic
- **Contingency:** Manual invitation fallback for Sprint 1

### Medium Risk: Tenant Data Isolation
- **Impact:** Security vulnerability, data leakage
- **Mitigation:** Row-level security policies, comprehensive testing
- **Contingency:** Additional security review before Sprint completion

## Development Standards

### Code Quality Requirements
- TDD approach for all authentication components
- Unit tests for role validation logic
- Integration tests for authentication flows  
- E2E tests for role-based access control
- Security tests for privilege escalation prevention

### Documentation Requirements
- API documentation for authentication endpoints
- Role permission matrices
- Database schema documentation
- Deployment and configuration guides

## Sprint Completion Criteria

### Definition of Done (All Tasks)
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Database migrations applied and tested
- [ ] Tests passing with required coverage
- [ ] Security audit completed
- [ ] Documentation updated  
- [ ] UX/UI review completed for user-facing features
- [ ] Product Manager acceptance obtained

### Sprint Demo Requirements
- [ ] Tenant Admin can create teacher accounts
- [ ] Email invitations working end-to-end
- [ ] Role-based access demonstrated
- [ ] Multi-tenant data isolation verified
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met

## Next Sprint Preparation

### Sprint 2 Dependencies
Sprint 1 completion enables Sprint 2 tasks:
- Student Invitation System (requires email service + tenant admin)
- Class Management System (requires role-based auth)
- Progress Analytics Foundation (requires user roles)
