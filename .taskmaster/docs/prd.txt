# Gemeos Platform - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Product Vision & Mission
Gemeos is an AI-powered, multi-tenant educational platform that creates adaptive learning experiences through human-in-the-loop AI feedback. The platform supports various learning domains (Jazz, GMAT, etc.) and enables educational organizations to deliver personalized curriculum while continuously improving AI-generated content through teacher feedback.

## Core Product Goals
1. **Adaptive Learning Platform**: Provide students with personalized learning paths and real-time feedback
2. **Human-AI Collaboration**: Enable teachers/admins to review, approve, or reject AI-generated suggestions
3. **Continuous AI Improvement**: Learn from human feedback loops to enhance AI output quality over time
4. **Multi-Tenant Architecture**: Support multiple organizations with domain-specific customization
5. **Scalable Content Generation**: Automated creation of concepts, learning goals, and exercises

- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Real-time)
- **AI Pipeline**: Google Cloud (Pub/Sub, GCS, Vertex AI/Gemini)
- **Infrastructure**: Multi-tenant with data isolation

### Key Data Entities

#### 1. Domains
- Subject areas (Jazz, GMAT, Physics)
- Client-specific activation
- Hierarchical concept organization
- Domain-specific guidance files

#### 2. Concepts  
- Knowledge building blocks within domains
- Hierarchical parent/child relationships
- Additional relationships (prerequisite, related)
- Status workflow: suggested â†’ approved/rejected
- Source tracking: ai vs human

#### 3. Learning Goals
- Objectives tied to concepts
- AI-generated, teacher-refined
- Bloom's taxonomy level, difficulty, sequence metadata
- Same workflow + source tracking as concepts

#### 4. Exercises
- Practical tasks for learners
- Linked to learning goals and concepts
- Multiple formats (quiz, interactive, problem sets)
- Follows same approval workflow

### AI Pipeline Components

#### 1. Preprocessor (Cloud Run Service)
- Domain-agnostic text/MIDI/audio extraction
- Saves to Supabase (domain_extracted_files table)
- Publishes to Pub/Sub for next step triggering

#### 2. Concept Chunker (Cloud Function)
- Splits raw text into manageable chunks
- AI-powered candidate concept proposal
- Inserts into concepts table with status=suggested

#### 3. Concept Structurer (Cloud Function)
- Processes approved concepts
- Suggests hierarchies via suggested_concept_hierarchies
- Domain-specific guidance from GCS

#### 4. Learning Goal Generator (Cloud Function)
- Uses concept text + guidance + examples
- Generates learning goals via Gemini AI
- Stores with status=suggested

#### 5. Exercise Generator (Future)
- Similar workflow for exercise generation
- Tied to learning goals
