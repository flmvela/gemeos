# AI Content Management System - Implementation Documentation

## Overview
Date: January 13, 2025
Implemented by: Development Team with Claude Code assistance

The AI Content Management System provides intelligent content generation, refinement, and review capabilities for educational materials across concepts, learning goals, and exercises.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Review AI Dashboard** (`/src/pages/ReviewAI.tsx`)
   - Multi-tab interface for reviewing AI-generated content
   - Support for concepts, learning goals, and exercises
   - Batch operations for approval/rejection
   - Real-time search and filtering

2. **AI Suggestions Service** (`/src/services/ai-suggestions.service.ts`)
   - Service layer for managing AI suggestions
   - Methods for fetching, approving, and rejecting content
   - Automatic content creation from approved suggestions

3. **Edge Functions** (Supabase Functions)
   - `ai-content-processor`: Main processing pipeline
   - `ai-concept-enrichment`: Specialized concept enhancement
   - OpenAI GPT-4 integration for intelligent processing

4. **Database Schema**
   - Comprehensive tables for AI processing and review workflow
   - Support for multi-tenancy and role-based access

## Database Schema

### New Tables Created

#### `ai_processing_jobs`
Tracks all AI processing requests with status, timestamps, and metrics.

#### `ai_suggestions`
Stores AI-generated suggestions with:
- Content type (concept/learning_goal/exercise)
- Original and suggested content
- Confidence scores
- Review status (pending/approved/rejected)
- AI reasoning explanations

#### `ai_review_queue` (View)
Optimized view for efficient review workflow combining suggestions with processing job metadata.

#### `bloom_taxonomy`
Reference table with 6 Bloom's Taxonomy levels:
- Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, Create

#### Supporting Tables
- `ai_concept_relationships`: Tracks relationships between concepts
- `ai_learning_sequences`: Manages learning goal sequences
- `ai_user_feedback`: Captures user feedback on AI suggestions
- `ai_processing_metrics`: Aggregated metrics for monitoring

### Modified Tables

#### `learning_goals`
Added columns:
- `title`: Extracted from goal_description for UI display
- `description`: Copy of goal_description for consistency
- `tenant_id`: Multi-tenancy support
- Standardized `bloom_level` values

## Features Implemented

### 1. Review AI Dashboard
- **URL Routes**: 
  - `/admin/domains/:slug/review-ai` (Domain admins)
  - `/teacher/review-ai` (Teachers)
- **Access**: Platform admins, tenant admins, teachers
- **Capabilities**:
  - View pending AI suggestions grouped by type
  - Select multiple items for batch operations
  - Approve/reject with one click
  - Edit suggestions before approval
  - Search and filter content
  - Refresh to check for new suggestions

### 2. AI Processing Pipeline

#### Concept Processing
- **Refinement**: Improve titles and descriptions
- **Difficulty Assignment**: Automatic difficulty level (1-10 scale)
- **Relationship Generation**: Identify connections between concepts
- **Hierarchy Creation**: Build parent-child relationships
- **Gap Analysis**: Suggest missing concepts for curriculum completion

#### Learning Goal Processing
- **Generation from Concepts**: Create goals based on existing concepts
- **Bloom's Taxonomy**: Automatic classification into 6 levels
- **Sequencing**: Determine optimal learning order
- **Prerequisite Management**: Track dependencies
- **Refinement**: Improve clarity and measurability

#### Exercise Processing
- **Content Generation**: Create exercises from concepts/goals
- **Difficulty Matching**: Align with concept difficulty
- **Answer Generation**: Create sample answers
- **Variation Creation**: Generate multiple exercise types

### 3. Approval Workflow

1. **Content Upload/Generation**
   - Platform admin/tenant admin/teacher uploads content
   - System triggers AI processing

2. **AI Processing**
   - Content analyzed and enhanced
   - Suggestions generated with confidence scores
   - Stored in `ai_suggestions` table

3. **Review Queue**
   - Suggestions appear in Review AI dashboard
   - Grouped by content type
   - Sortable by confidence, date, etc.

4. **Review Actions**
   - **Approve**: Creates actual content in respective tables
   - **Reject**: Marks as rejected with optional notes
   - **Edit**: Modify before approval
   - **Bulk Operations**: Select multiple items

5. **Content Creation**
   - Approved suggestions automatically create:
     - Concepts in `concepts` table
     - Learning goals in `learning_goals` table
     - Exercises in `exercises` table

## Technical Implementation Details

### Frontend Components

#### ReviewAI.tsx Structure
```typescript
- Content type cards (visual selection)
- Search bar with real-time filtering
- Data table with:
  - Checkbox selection
  - Content details
  - Bloom's level badges
  - Sequence numbers
  - Action buttons
- Batch action buttons (Approve/Reject)
```

#### State Management
- React hooks for local state
- TanStack Query for server state (prepared for integration)
- Mock data for demonstration

### Backend Services

#### Edge Function Features
- Streaming responses for long operations
- Error handling with detailed messages
- Configurable processing options
- Support for bulk operations
- Token usage tracking

#### OpenAI Integration
- Model: GPT-4 Turbo
- Temperature: 0.7 for balanced creativity
- JSON response format enforced
- Retry logic for API failures

### Security & Access Control

#### Row Level Security (RLS)
- Policies ensure users only see their tenant's data
- Role-based management permissions
- Platform admins have universal access

#### API Security
- Edge functions use service role key
- CORS configured for frontend access
- Input validation on all endpoints

## Migration Scripts

- [ ] Verify batch selection works
- [ ] Confirm approve creates content
- [ ] Check reject removes from queue
- [ ] Test page refresh updates counts

### Mock Data

1. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live updates
2. **Bulk Upload**: CSV/Excel file import
3. **AI Feedback Loop**: Learn from approval/rejection patterns
4. **Custom Prompts**: Domain-specific AI instructions
5. **Version History**: Track changes to content
6. **Export Functionality**: Download approved content

### Performance Optimizations
1. Implement pagination for large datasets
2. Add caching layer for frequently accessed content
3. Optimize database queries with materialized views
4. Implement background job processing

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Column does not exist" errors
- Run the latest migration scripts
- Check table structure matches expectations

#### AI Processing Fails
- Verify OpenAI API key is valid
- Check rate limits haven't been exceeded
- Review Edge Function logs

#### Content Not Appearing in Review
