# Gemeos Multi-Tenant Platform - Requirements Package

## Project Scope Statement

Gemeos is a multi-tenant educational platform enabling organizations (schools, districts, educational institutions) to manage curriculum delivery through a hierarchical content structure of domains, concepts, learning goals, and exercises. The platform provides role-based access control with four distinct user types: Platform Admins (manage system-wide configuration and content), Tenant Admins (manage organizational settings and users), Teachers (deliver and customize curriculum), and Students (consume educational content). The system supports content inheritance from platform to tenant level with customization capabilities, class-based learning organization, and invitation-based student enrollment.

**Out of scope:** payment processing, third-party LMS integration, mobile applications, content authoring tools beyond basic CRUD, real-time collaboration features, and gradebook functionality.
