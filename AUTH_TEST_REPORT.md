# Authentication System Test Report

**Date:** 2025-09-09  
**Test Environment:** http://localhost:8086  
**Test Framework:** Playwright with Chromium

## Executive Summary

Comprehensive testing was performed on the authentication and redirect system for both platform admin and tenant admin users. The tenant admin functionality is working perfectly with all tests passing. However, the platform admin user authentication is failing due to invalid credentials.

## Test Results Summary

| User Type | Tests Run | Passed | Failed | Success Rate |
|-----------|-----------|---------|---------|--------------|
| Platform Admin | 5 | 0 | 1 | 0% (4 not tested due to login failure) |
| Tenant Admin | 5 | 5 | 0 | 100% |
| **Overall** | **10** | **5** | **1** | **50%** |

## Detailed Test Results

### 1. Platform Admin (admin@gemeos.ai)

#### Test Status: ‚ùå CRITICAL FAILURE

| Test Case | Status | Details |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Login | ‚ùå FAIL | Invalid login credentials - all attempted passwords failed |
| Dashboard Redirect | ‚è≥ NOT TESTED | Could not proceed due to login failure |
| Navigation | ‚è≥ NOT TESTED | Could not proceed due to login failure |
| Session Persistence | ‚è≥ NOT TESTED | Could not proceed due to login failure |
| Cross-Navigation | ‚è≥ NOT TESTED | Could not proceed due to login failure |

**Console Errors Detected:** 8 errors related to authentication failure
- `AuthApiError: Invalid login credentials`
- HTTP 400 errors from authentication endpoint

**Evidence:** Screenshot saved as `platform-admin-login-fail.png`

### 2. Tenant Admin (flm.velardi+ta1010@gmail.com)

#### Test Status: ‚úÖ FULLY OPERATIONAL

| Test Case | Status | Details |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Login | ‚úÖ PASS | Successfully authenticated with password "Tenant2025!" |
| Dashboard Redirect | ‚úÖ PASS | Correctly redirected to /tenant/dashboard |
| Navigation | ‚úÖ PASS | Can navigate to public pages and return to dashboard |
| Session Persistence | ‚úÖ PASS | Session maintained after page refresh |
| Cross-Navigation | ‚úÖ PASS | Correctly blocked from accessing /admin/dashboard |

**Console Errors:** None detected  
**Evidence:** Screenshot saved as `tenant-admin-dashboard.png`

## Cross-Navigation Test Results

| Test Scenario | Result | Behavior |
|---------------|--------|----------|
| Tenant Admin ‚Üí Platform Dashboard | ‚úÖ PASS | Access correctly denied |
| Tenant Admin ‚Üí Public Pages | ‚úÖ PASS | Access granted as expected |
| Platform Admin ‚Üí Tenant Dashboard | ‚è≥ NOT TESTED | Could not test due to login failure |

## Session Persistence Tests

| User | Test | Result |
|------|------|--------|
| Tenant Admin | Page Refresh | ‚úÖ Session maintained |
| Tenant Admin | Navigate Away & Back | ‚úÖ Session maintained |
| Platform Admin | All tests | ‚è≥ Could not test |

## Critical Issues Identified

### üö® Issue #1: Platform Admin Authentication Failure
- **Severity:** CRITICAL
- **Impact:** Platform admin cannot access the system
- **Root Cause:** Invalid credentials or missing user in database
- **Attempted Passwords:**
  - Admin2025! (primary)
  - Admin123!
  - admin2025
  - Admin@2025
- **Recommendation:** 
  1. Verify platform admin user exists in auth.users table
  2. Reset password to Admin2025!
  3. Ensure user_profiles record exists with role='platform_admin'

## Success Criteria Evaluation

| Criterion | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Both users can login without errors | ‚ùå FAIL | Platform admin cannot login |
| Correct dashboard redirects for each role | ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL | Tenant admin works, platform admin untested |
| No "Access Denied" pages for authorized routes | ‚úÖ PASS | Tenant admin has proper access |
| No session timeouts or unexpected logouts | ‚úÖ PASS | Tenant admin session stable |
| No console errors related to authentication | ‚ùå FAIL | Platform admin generates auth errors |

## Test Artifacts

The following test artifacts were generated:
- `platform-admin-login-fail.png` - Screenshot of failed login attempt
- `tenant-admin-dashboard.png` - Screenshot of successful dashboard access
- `test-auth-system.spec.ts` - Playwright test specification
- `test-auth-manual.cjs` - Manual authentication test script
- `test-auth-final.cjs` - Comprehensive test suite

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required:
1. **Fix Platform Admin Authentication**
   - Create or verify platform admin user in Supabase
   - Set password to "Admin2025!"
   - Verify user_profiles record with correct role

2. **Database Verification**
   ```sql
   -- Check if platform admin exists
   SELECT * FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'admin@gemeos.ai';
   
   -- Check user profile
   SELECT * FROM user_profiles WHERE email = 'admin@gemeos.ai';
   ```

3. **After Fix, Re-run Tests**
   - Execute: `node test-auth-final.cjs`
   - Verify all platform admin tests pass

### System Observations:
- ‚úÖ Tenant admin authentication system is fully functional
- ‚úÖ Role-based access control working correctly for tenant admin
- ‚úÖ Session management is stable and persistent
- ‚úÖ Public page access works as expected
- ‚ùå Platform admin user needs to be created or fixed in database

## Conclusion

The authentication system is **partially operational**. The tenant admin functionality is working perfectly with 100% test success rate, demonstrating that the core authentication and authorization infrastructure is sound. However, the platform admin user cannot authenticate, which appears to be a data issue rather than a system issue.

**Overall System Health: 50% - Requires immediate attention to restore platform admin access**
