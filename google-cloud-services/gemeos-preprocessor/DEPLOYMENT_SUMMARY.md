# GEMEOS Preprocessor Deployment Summary

## ✅ Deployment Successful

**Service URL**: https://gemeos-preprocessor-63o6zv4roa-ew.a.run.app  
**Region**: europe-west1  
**Project**: cyvian  
**Status**: ✅ Running  

## 🏗️ What Was Built

### 1. **main.py** - Core Service Logic
- **Domain-based routing**: Maps domain slugs to specific GCS buckets
  - `jazz-music` → `gemeos-jazz`
  - `gmat` → `gemeos-gmat`
- **Content type organization**: Routes files to appropriate paths
  - Concepts → `/concepts/ingestion/`
  - Learning Goals → `/learning-goals/ingestion/`
  - Exercises → `/exercises/ingestion/`
- **Lazy client initialization**: Prevents startup failures if env vars missing
- **Multiple endpoints**:
  - `GET /` - Health check
  - `POST /` - Pub/Sub message handler
  - `POST /process` - Direct API upload
  - `GET /domains` - List configured domains

### 2. **requirements.txt** - Dependencies
- Flask 3.0.0 for web framework
- Google Cloud Storage & Pub/Sub clients
- Supabase client for database operations
- Minimal dependencies for fast startup

### 3. **Dockerfile** - Optimized Container
- Python 3.11 slim base image
- Non-root user for security
- Health check configured
- Efficient layer caching

### 4. **GCS Bucket Structure**
```
gemeos-jazz/
├── concepts/
│   └── ingestion/
├── learning-goals/
│   └── ingestion/
├── exercises/
│   └── ingestion/
└── guidance/

## 🔄 File Processing Flow

1. **Upload Trigger**: File uploaded to source bucket
2. **Notification**: Pub/Sub message or direct API call
3. **Routing Logic**: 
   - Extract domain slug and content type
   - Determine target bucket and path
4. **File Copy**: Copy to domain-specific bucket with metadata
5. **Metadata Extraction**: Extract file info and preview
6. **Database Update**: Store record in Supabase
7. **Downstream Trigger**: Publish event for further processing

## 🔑 Key Features Implemented

### ✅ Domain-Based Routing
- Files automatically routed to correct bucket based on domain
- Supports multiple domain aliases
- Fallback to default naming pattern for new domains

### ✅ Content Type Organization
- Automatic path structuring based on content type
- Timestamped file names to prevent conflicts
- Metadata preservation during copy

### ✅ Error Handling
- Comprehensive logging for debugging
- Graceful failure with detailed error messages
- Health check endpoint for monitoring

### ✅ Security
- Non-root container execution
- Service account with minimal permissions
- Environment-based configuration

## 📊 Testing the Service

### Test Health Check
```bash
curl https://gemeos-preprocessor-63o6zv4roa-ew.a.run.app/
```

### Test Domain Listing
```bash
curl https://gemeos-preprocessor-63o6zv4roa-ew.a.run.app/domains
```

### Test Direct Upload (POST /process)
```bash
curl -X POST https://gemeos-preprocessor-63o6zv4roa-ew.a.run.app/process \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "domain_slug": "jazz-music",
    "content_type": "concepts",
    "file_info": {
      "file_name": "test.pdf",
      "source_bucket": "upload-bucket",
      "source_path": "temp/test.pdf",
      "uploaded_by": "user-123"
    }
  }'
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Frontend Integration
The upload components in the frontend need to:
1. Include `domain_slug` in upload metadata
2. Specify `content_type` (concepts/learning-goals/exercises)
3. Call the preprocessor service after upload

### Database Tables
Create the following tables in Supabase:
- `domain_concepts_files`
- `domain_learning_goals_files`
- `domain_exercises_files`

### Pub/Sub Topics
Create topics for downstream processing:
```bash
gcloud pubsub topics create concepts-processor-trigger
gcloud pubsub topics create learning-goals-processor-trigger
gcloud pubsub topics create exercises-processor-trigger
```

### Add Upload Options
For the UI pages that don't have upload yet:
- Learning Goals page needs upload button
- Exercises page needs upload button
- Both should follow same pattern as Concepts page

## 📝 Important Notes

1. **Environment Variables**: Currently using production Supabase credentials. Consider using Secret Manager in production.

2. **Bucket Permissions**: Ensure Cloud Run service account has:
   - `storage.objects.create` on target buckets
   - `storage.objects.get` on source buckets
   - `pubsub.topics.publish` on topics

3. **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for:
   - Service errors (5xx responses)
   - High latency (>5s response time)
   - Failed file copies

4. **Scaling**: Service auto-scales based on load. Consider setting max instances to control costs.

## ✨ Success Metrics

- ✅ Service deployed and running
- ✅ Domain-based routing configured
- ✅ Content type paths structured
- ✅ GCS buckets created with proper structure
- ✅ Health check passing
- ✅ Ready for frontend integration

The preprocessor is now ready to handle file uploads and route them to the appropriate domain-specific buckets!
